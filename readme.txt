Display Facebook's facepile, and feeds from Pinterest, Twitter, StumbleUpon, and Google+, with tabs

== Description ==

Display the Facebook facepile, and feeds from Pinterest, Twitter, StumbleUpon, and Google+ in your sidebar or other widgetized area (depending on theme support).

The widget displays the social feeds in tabs which can be set to display on the left or top. If enough people show an interest in the plugin then I may take the time to develop more display options. But for now it's simple, easy to use, and quick to set up. Just activate the widget and fill out what feeds to pull.

Google+ will require an api key from Google, but if you don't care to do the work to get one than just leave the fields blank and the widget will skip Google+.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `social-glutton` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the widgets menu under Appearance and add the Social Glutton widget to your sidebar or any other theme supported widget area
